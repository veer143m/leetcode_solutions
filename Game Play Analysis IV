Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.

The result format is in the following example.
---SQL Query

 WITH FirstLogin AS (
  SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
  FROM Activity
  GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity a
JOIN FirstLogin f 
  ON a.player_id = f.player_id 
 AND a.event_date = DATE_ADD(f.first_login_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY);
